<h2>Featured Review</h2>
<h3>Stephen King's best adapted movie</h3>
<p>
  I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw
  <strong> The Shawshank Redemption.</strong> Shawshank encompasses <br />
  friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the
  movie is that it moves you, it gives you <br />
  hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are
  quite different, you don't feel that far <br />
  removed from what the characters are going through.<br />
</p>
<p>
  King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle
  Rock series are some of the greatest stories <br />
  ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The
  Shining was brilliantly interpreted by <br />
  Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by
  Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont <br />
  comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to
  understand what King wants to say <br />
  and he conveys that beautifully.
  <br />

<p>
  What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It
  is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, <br />
  played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit.
  But he never loses hope. He never <br />
  gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience
  and wits keep him not only sane, but it <br />
  gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to
  it. There has never been anything like it <br />
  before and I don't know if there will again.
